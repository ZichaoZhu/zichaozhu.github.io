# Always blocks (clocked)

## What is clocked always block?

For hardware synthesis, there are two types of `always` blocks that are relevant:

- Combinational: `always @(*)`
- Clocked: `always @(posedge clk)`

Clocked always blocks create a blob of combinational logic just like combinational always blocks, but also creates a set of flip-flops (or "registers") at the output of the blob of combinational logic. Instead of the outputs of the blob of logic being visible immediately, the outputs are visible only immediately after the next (posedge clk).

## Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignment

There are three types of assignments in Verilog:

- **Continuous** assignments (`assign x = y;`). Can only be used when **not** inside a procedure ("always block").
- Procedural **blocking** assignment: (`x = y;`). Can only be used inside a procedure.
- Procedural **non-blocking** assignment: (`x <= y;`). Can only be used inside a procedure.

In a **combinational** always block, use **blocking** assignments. In a **clocked** always block, use **non-blocking** assignments. A full understanding of why is not particularly useful for hardware design and requires a good understanding of how Verilog simulators keep track of events. Not following this rule results in extremely hard to find errors that are both non-deterministic and differ between simulation and synthesized hardware.

## Practice

### Problem statement

> Build an XOR gate three ways, using an assign statement, a combinational always block, and a clocked always block. Note that the clocked always block produces a different circuit from the other two: There is a flip-flop so the output is delayed.

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff   );

endmodule
```

### Solution

```verilog
// synthesis verilog_input_version verilog_2001
module top_module(
    input clk,
    input a,
    input b,
    output wire out_assign,
    output reg out_always_comb,
    output reg out_always_ff   );
	assign out_assign=a^b;
    always @(*) out_always_comb=a^b;
    always @(posedge clk) out_always_ff<=a^b;
endmodule
```
